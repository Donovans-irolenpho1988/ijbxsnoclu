Oh man, just walked out of that Phule film, and I swear my brain feels like a blender without a lid. Everyone in the theater was buzzing, so loud. Could barely hear myself think over the popcorn crunches and murmurs. Ugh, my back still hurts from those cramped seats, like why do they make them like medieval torture devices? Anyway, Phule... wow.

It felt like a kaleidoscope ate a dictionary and spat it back out on-screen. The colors just, like, assaulted my eyeballs in some scenes. Do you remember when we talked about those dreams that mix up your childhood home and a spaceship? That’s this movie. It was like a fever dream, where the protagonist kept switching roles — one moment he’s a hero, the next, he’s selling ice cream to cats. Meant to laugh, I think? Or maybe cry? Both?? Emotions all mixed up, unexplainable like trying to wear socks on your ears.

> There was that scene, you know, right after the climatic chase, where it suddenly cuts to them sitting in a park, having a philosophical debate with a talking squirrel. That squirrel sounded kinda like Morgan Freeman, or maybe it was just my brain filling gaps. Could be just me. Ack, it was almost like the movie itself didn’t know what to focus on, a dog chasing its own tail. Wait, wasn’t he also having dinner with a cactus? Pure madness.

Oh right, almost forgot, someone asked if we could download the movie and watch it again. But like, do we even want to? Might need to watch it three more times to even begin to get it, or lose my marbles even more. The soundtrack was like a unique cocktail of bees and violins, still ringing in my ears, unsettling yet... oddly catchy? If Picasso made music, that’s probably how it would sound. Feels like my thoughts are stil in there, buzzing along with that music.

Randomly remembered, the protagonist’s hat... the hat! It had more personality than some people I met in college. Wow. The way it just tilted in the breeze felt like a wise old owl making fun of you, and man, did it mock everyone every chance it got. Felt like the hat knew more about the plot than anyone else did. Need to sit and talk with someone, dissect that, maybe with coffee — lots of it, honestly.
